# Implementation-AES-Algo
Modules for implementation of AES algo
 
 Hey Developers!
 
 This repo will help you somehow if you are seeking a proper implementation of the famous AES algorithm. It is written in C.
 I have added comments in between the code to simplify what each and every function is doing.
 
 The AES algorithm is an advancement over the exisiting DES or 3DES algo's and is a combination of various functions that represent the whole process of converting a value into an ecrypted and how the decryption works.
 
 Therefore, there are different modules that represent a single step in the combined AES algorithm process.
